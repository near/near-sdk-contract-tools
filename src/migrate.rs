//! Migrate pattern implements methods to change the storage representation of a struct.
//!
//! The migration controller takes the old and new schema and deserializes
//! the contract state from the old schema. The [`on_migrate`][`MigrateHook::on_migrate`]
//! method takes this state and replaces it with the new schema.
//! [`MigrateExternal`] exposes this functionality publicly.
//!
//! The crate exports a [derive macro](near_sdk_contract_tools_macros::Migrate)
//! that derives a default implementation for migration.
//!
//! Note: [`MigrateHook`] must be implemented by the user and is not derived
//! by default. It must convert data in the old schema to the new schema without
//! failing. For a complete example checkout [upgrade_new.rs](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-contract-tools/blob/develop/workspaces-tests/src/bin/upgrade_new.rs)
//! in workspace-tests.
//!
//! # Safety
//! The contract state must conform to the old schema otherwise deserializing it
//! will fail and throw an error.
#![allow(missing_docs)] // #[ext_contract(...)] does not play nicely with clippy
